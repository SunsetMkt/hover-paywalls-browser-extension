2. Unzip the file and you should have a folder named `hover-paywalls-browser-extension-master`.
3. In Chrome go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).
4. Enable Developer Mode at the top right.

6. Enjoy!

## Download from the Chrome Web Store (10,000+ Downloads + 5/5 Rating) (Down because Google does not allow bypassing paywalls):

# How To Use / Demo
Enable in Hover Extension in Google Chrome, and you should see it on the top right along with your other Chrome extensions. \
To bypass paywalls on the website domain you're on, simply click on the "Bypass Paywalls" toggle button. \
It should work automatically! Enjoy :) \

If it doesn't work right away, go to the "Advanced" tab, and try different combinations of the strategies to bypass the paywal using the Toggle buttons. Almost always, enabling just one of them will do the trick, but it depends on the website. 

Many times, clicking "Block Cookies" and then "Unblock Cookies" will do the trick, as you clear your stored cookies!

# How To Contribute
Fork the repository and improve Hover!
Make edits in src folder, and then run ```npm run build```. This will create the dist folder, which is used by browsers (see Download Locally Step 5).

Current stable version: 2.2.7
Dev version: 2.2.8

Transfer into a Firefox extension. \
Make Hover work for more sites. \
